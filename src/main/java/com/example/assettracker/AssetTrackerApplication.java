/*
 * AssetTrackerApplication
 * -----------------------
 * This is the entry point of a Spring Boot application.
 * - @SpringBootApplication tells Spring to enable auto-configuration,
 *   component scanning, and to treat this as the main configuration class.
 * - The main method delegates to SpringApplication.run which starts the
 *   embedded web server, creates the application context, and wires up
 *   components (controllers, services, repositories, etc.).
 *
 * Students: Think of this class as "turning on" the Spring framework
 * for this project. You normally won't change much here when learning.
